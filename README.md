# Stoneworks Custom Dynmap
*its been 4 weeks and we still dont have an official map*

The current aim: make a useful and functional dynamic map

The future aim (post official map): make a more useful and better performing dynamic map

## How I got the data
- dynmap was avalible for a short duration a while ago, i managed to grab backups of api calls while working on this project
  - spent litteral 2 hours writing code to parse the garbage data *(litterally raw html)*
- @albsi on discord created a combine map based on submitted map mod exports, kindly they let me use it

***want to use my parsed data without violating the license? dm me and i can provide :)***
